    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      vegetable broths. If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just use one or the other.

    <ul>
      <strong>Chicken:</strong> Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken,
      you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <strong>Noodles:</strong> Make sure you don"t add the noodles too early, as cooking
      them too long will make them mushy.
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <strong>Carrots:</strong> Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the 
      end of the cooking so they stay crisp. You can add them to the sauteed vegetables at
      the beginning if you like your carrots tender.

      <strong>Basil and Oregano:</strong> Dried basil and oregano lend warm, earthy flavor to this
